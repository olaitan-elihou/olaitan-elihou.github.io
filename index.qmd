I am a passionate data analyst with a strong foundation in applied statistics and a growing career in quantitative data analysis. Currently pursuing a doctoral thesis in Demography, I have over five years of experience in research methods across Central and West Africa, where I excel in designing data collection tools and analyzing data using R and Stata. I am dedicated to turning complex data into compelling stories and continually strive to enhance my skills in data visualization and statistical learning.
